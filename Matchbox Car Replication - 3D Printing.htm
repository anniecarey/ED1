  For this project, we were tasked with creating a 3D model and 3D print of a toy car to scale. Our goal was to represent our car accurately with a 3D model. I chose a Hot Wheels pizza truck. We used Onshape to extrude a 2d drawing on the  X, Y, and Z planes to make it 3D. We also had to orient our model in Cura and 3D print it. Mrs. Hedstrom also helped me create stickers to put on the side of my car.

<h3> Guidelines </h3>
<p> These are the guidelines for our project:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Car designed as an intersection of three forms</li>
  <li> Design car in a 1:1 ratio</li>
  <li> Size accuracy ±1% </li>
  <li> Design is exported as stl</li>
  <li> Student orients model in Cura for 3D printing to minimize support material </li>
  <li>File is exported as a gcode </li>
  <li> Final design is shared out as an embedded STL on an HTML webpage </li>
</ul>
<h3> Project steps: </h3>
<p> 
</p><ul>
  <li>Create Onshape account and download Cura </li>
  <li>Choose a toy model to replicate (Hot Wheels ice cream truck) </li>
  <li>Create an engineering drawing (draw the X, Y, and Z planes of your car)
    
    
    
     <img src="./3D Car Reflection/engineeringdrawing.png" style="width: 40%">
<figcaption> (This is my beginning engineering drawing)</figcaption></li>
  <li>Scan or photograph your drawing and upload it to your computer</li>
  <li>Take screenshots of each plane 
 </li>
  <li>Go onto Onshape and create a rectangular prism with the same dimensions as your car </li>
  <li>Import the images on to the X, Y, and Z planes of the rectangular prism </li>
  <li>Use the pen tool to draw each profile on each plane side </li>
  <li>Use the extrusion tool to remove the negative space and form your 3D model </li>
  <li>Use the extrusion tool and fillet tool for finishing details  </li>
  <li>Export the STL file
 </li>
  <li>Import your design into Cura </li>
  <li>Make any final scaling changes (not recommended in instruction video)</li>
  <li>Position 3D model on the build plate to minimize support material </li>
  <li>Change the setting to a .6mm nozzle </li>
  <li>Export as a GCODE file </li>
  <li>Print model </li>
  
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3> The process: </h3>
<p> 
I started by drawing my car from the front, back, and side. Then, I uploaded it to my computer and made an Onshape account. Next, I made a rectangular prism with the same dimensions as my car, imported the screenshots of each side of my car, and pasted them on to each side.

 I then used the pen tool to trace my drawings and used the extrusion tool to remove the negative space.

  I could have stopped there but I really wanted to add some more details. I added circles and lines for headlights and other details on the front. I added my name on the back. I added three windows and then I added texture to the top of the car along with the shapes that stuck out of the top of my hot wheels truck. Finally, I spent what felt like 100 hours on making details on the tire to make them look more realistic.

  I then imported my design into Cura and printed it. I also, with the help of Ms. Hedstrom, added stickers of pizza, flames, and chefs.

<h3> Challenges, Setbacks, How I Overcame </h3>
<p>
One challenge I faced was that the details on my car did not show up on the 3D printed model. This was extremely disappointing as I had spent a lot of time on the details — especially the tires. The only way to fix that problem would be having a nozzle that is smaller than .6 mm or to make my car a lot bigger so that the .6mm nozzle would be able to print those details.  Another challenge I faced was on the CAD drawing. I could not figure out how to get a front isometric view of my car.

</p><figcaption> (This is the problem I faced with the isometric view) </figcaption>


 I tried deleting my car and then re-pasting it into a different onshape drawing and nothing seemed to work. Luckily in class, someone taught me how to do it. All I had to do was hover over the edge of the side view until it gave me the option to put down a front isometric view.
